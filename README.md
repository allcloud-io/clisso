# Clisso: CLI Single Sign-On

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/allcloud-io/clisso/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/allcloud-io/clisso)

Clisso (pronounced `/ˈklIsoʊ/`) allows you to retrieve temporary credentials for cloud platforms
by authenticating with an identity provider (IdP).

The following identity providers are currently supported:

- [OneLogin][2]
- [Okta][3]

The following cloud platforms are currently supported:

- [AWS][1]

Clisso uses the [SAML][7] standard to authenticate users.

## Installation

### Using a Pre-Compiled Binary

The easiest way to use Clisso is to download a pre-compiled binary for your platform. To do so,
perform the following:

1. Go to the [latest release][4] on the releases page.
1. Download the ZIP file corresponding to your platform and architecture.
1. Unzip the binary.
1. Rename the binary using `mv clisso-<platform>-<arch> clisso`.
1. Move the binary to a place under your path.

Clisso supports **macOS**, **Linux** and **Windows**.

### Installing Using Homebrew

To install Clisso using Homebrew, run the following commands:

    brew tap allcloud-io/tools
    brew install clisso

To update Clisso to the latest release, run the following command:

    brew upgrade clisso

### Building from Source

#### Requirements

- Go `1.12` or above
- Git
- Make

#### Building

To build Clisso from source, do the following:

```
# Get the source
git clone github.com/allcloud-io/clisso

# Build the binary
cd clisso
make

# Install the binary in $GOPATH/bin
make install

# Clean up
make clean
```

## Configuration

Clisso stores configuration in a file called `.clisso.yaml` under the user's home directory. You
may specify a different config file using the `-c` flag.

>NOTE: It is recommended to use the `clisso` command to manage the config file, however you may
>also edit the file manually. The file is in YAML format. You may find a sample config file
>[here][11].

## Usage

Clisso has the following commands:

    $ ./clisso
    Usage:
    clisso [command]

    Available Commands:
    apps        Manage apps
    get         Get temporary credentials for an app
    help        Help about any command
    providers   Manage providers
    status      Show active (non-expired) credentials
    version     Show version info

    Flags:
    -c, --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.clisso.yaml)
    -h, --help            help for clisso

    Use "clisso [command] --help" for more information about a command.

In order to use Clisso you will have to configure at least one *provider* and one *app*. A provider
represents an identity provider against which Clisso authenticates. An app represents an account
on a cloud platform such as AWS, for which Clisso retrieves credentials.

### Listing Providers

To list the existing providers on Clisso, use the following command:

    clisso providers ls

Following is a sample output:

    okta-prod
    onelogin-dev
    onelogin-prod

### Listing Apps

To list the existing apps on Clisso, use the following command:

    clisso apps ls

Following is a sample output:

      dev-account
    * prod-account

The app marked with an asterisk is [selected](#selecting-an-app).

### Creating Providers

#### OneLogin

To create a OneLogin identity provider, use the following command:

    clisso providers create onelogin my-provider \
        --client-id myid \
        --client-secret mysecret \
        --subdomain mycompany \
        --username user@mycompany.com \
        --region US \
        --duration 14400

The example above creates a OneLogin identity provider configuration for Clisso, with the name
`my-provider`.

The `--client-id` and `--client-secret` flags are OneLogin API credentials. You may follow the
instructions [here][8] to obtain them. OneLogin requires using static credentials even for
**attempting authentication**, and for that reason Clisso needs them. Please be sure to select
**Authentication Only** when generating the credentials. Higher-level permissions aren't used by
Clisso and will only pose a security risk when stored at a client machine.

The `--subdomain` flag is the subdomain of your OneLogin account. You can see it in the URL when
logging in to OneLogin. For example, if you log in to OneLogin using `mycompany.onelogin.com`, use
`--subdomain mycompany`.

The `--username` flag is optional, and allows Clisso to always use the given value as the OneLogin
username when retrieving credentials for apps which use this provider. Omitting this flag will make
Clisso prompt for a username every time.

The `--duration` flag is optional. If specified, sessions will be assumed with the provided
duration, in seconds, instead of the default of 3600 (1 hour). Valid values are between 3600 and
43200 seconds. The [max session duration][12] has be equal to or lower than what is configured on
the role in AWS. If a longer session time is requested than what is configured on the AWS role,
Clisso will fallback to a duration of 3600. The default duration specified for the provider can be
overridden on a per-app basis (see below).

#### Okta

To create an Okta identity provider, use the following command:

    clisso providers create okta my-provider \
        --base-url https://mycompany.okta.com \
        --username user@mycompany.com \
        --duration 14400

The example above creates an Okta identity provider configuration for Clisso, with the name
`my-provider`.

The `--base-url` flag is your Okta base URL. You can see it in the URL when logging in to Okta.
Please specify a full URL in one of the following formats:

- `https://your-subdomain.okta.com` if you have an enterprise Okta account.
- `https://your-subdomain.oktapreview.com` if you have a developer Okta account.

The `--username` flag is optional, and allows Clisso to always use the given value as the Okta
username when retrieving credentials for apps which use this provider. Omitting this flag will make
Clisso prompt for a username every time.

The `--duration` flag is optional. If specified, sessions will be assumed with the provided
duration, in seconds, instead of the default of 3600 (1 hour). Valid values are between 3600 and
43200 seconds. The [max session duration][12] has be equal to or lower than what is configured on
the role in AWS. If a longer session time is requested than what is configured on the AWS role,
Clisso will fallback to a duration of 3600. The default duration specified for the provider can be
overridden on a per-app basis (see below).

### Deleting Providers

Deleting providers using the `clisso` command isn't currently supported. To delete a provider,
remove its configuration from the config file.

### Creating Apps

#### OneLogin

To create a OneLogin app, use the following command:

    clisso apps create onelogin my-app \
        --provider my-provider \
        --app-id 12345 \
        --duration 3600

The example above creates a OneLogin app configuration for Clisso, with the name `my-app`.

The `--provider` flag is the name of a provider which already exists in the config file.

The `--app-id` flag is the OneLogin app ID. This ID can be retrieved using the OneLogin admin
interface or the OneLogin API. Unfortunately, the OneLogin API doesn't allow obtaining app IDs
without storing sensitive, high-level permissions on the client machine. For that reason we have to
manually configure the app ID for every app.

>NOTE: The ID seen in the browser URL when visiting a OneLogin app as a user is **NOT** the app ID.
>Only a OneLogin administrator can obtain an app ID.

The `--duration` flag is optional and defaults to the value set at the provider level. Valid values
are between 3600 and 43200 seconds. Can be used to raise or lower the session duration for an
individual app. The [max session duration][12] has be equal to or lower than what is configured on
the role in AWS. The default maximum is 3600 seconds. If the requested duration exceeds the
configured maximum Clisso will fallback to 3600 seconds.

#### Okta

To create an Okta app, use the following command:

    clisso apps create okta my-app \
        --provider my-provider \
        --url https://mycompany.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/137 \
        --duration 3600

The example above creates an Okta app configuration for Clisso, with the name `my-app`.

The `--provider` flag is the name of a provider which already exists in the config file.

The `--url` flag is the app's **embed link**. This can be retrieved as an Okta user by examining
the URL of an app on the Okta web UI. The same can also be retrieved as an administrator by
clicking an app in the **Applications** view. The embed link is on the **General** tab.

>NOTE: An Okta embed link must not contain an HTTP query, only the base URL. For AWS apps, the link
should end with `/137`.

The `--duration` flag is optional and defaults to the value set at the provider level. Valid values
are between 3600 and 43200 seconds. Can be used to raise or lower the session duration for an
individual app. The [max session duration][12] has be equal to or lower than what is configured on
the role in AWS. The default maximum is 3600 seconds. If the requested duration exceeds the
configured maximum Clisso will fallback to 3600 seconds.

### Deleting Apps

Deleting apps using the `clisso` command isn't currently supported. To delete an app, remove its
configuration from the config file.

### Obtaining Credentials

To obtain temporary credentials for an app, use the following command:

    clisso get my-app

The example above will obtain credentials for an app named `my-app`. Type your credentials for the
relevant identity provider. If multi-factor authentication is enabled on your account, you will be
asked in addition for a one-time password.

By default, Clisso will store the credentials in the [shared credentials file][6] of the AWS CLI
with the app's name as the [profile name][10]. You can use the temporary credentials by specifying
the profile name as an argument to the AWS CLI (`--profile my-profile`), by setting the
`AWS_PROFILE` environment variable or by configuring any AWS SDK to use the profile.

To save the credentials to a custom file, use the `-w` flag.

To print the credentials to the shell instead of storing them in a file, use the `-s` flag. This
will output shell commands which can be pasted in any shell to use the credentials.

### Storing the password in the keychain

> WARNING: Storing the password without having MFA enabled is a security risk. It allows anyone
> to assume your roles who has access to your computer.

Storing a password for a provider is as simple as running:

    clisso providers passwd my-provider

### Selecting an App

You can **select** an app by using the following command:

    clisso apps select my-app

You can get credentials for the currently-selected app by simply running `clisso get`, without
specifying an app name. The currently-selected app will have an asterisk near its name when listing
apps using `clisso apps ls`.

## Caveats and Limitations

- No support for Okta applications with MFA enabled **at the application level**.
- No support for storing passwords on Windows.
